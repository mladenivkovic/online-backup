Workflow to check consistency of Aij for swift/python:

-   get_Aij_my_way.py: best don't use this. All updates happen in check_Aij.py

-   check_gradients.py: calls compute gradients and dumps result files. Checks partial
    computations for gradients of psi, and final gradients as well.

-   check_Aij.py: Compares gradients first, then final Aij's. If you run check_gradients.py
    first, you don't need to re-compute the gradients with python. The file dumps can be
    re-used. The code will ask you whether you want to overwrite files. If you say no, it
    will use them to compare the results between swift and python.
