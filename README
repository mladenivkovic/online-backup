This directory stores various scripts / programs 
that I sorted in another directory (i.e. that don't belong
in this repo) but want to have an online backup of.

use the scripts scrbackup.sh in projects/scripts/ to create
links. It will write down the origin of the file in 
original_links.txt.
Then you can use scrbackuprestore.sh to restore them when
you need them restored.
'Restore' means re-create the links from the original source
path.
